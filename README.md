# Kwil DB Administrator

For this Arweave Hackathon I have focused on creating extensions and administrative tools for Kwil DB.
There are several repositories included as part of this project but this is the core repository.  Details of the other repositories will be included below.

## About
I am currently working on a Web3 project called Embrace Community and I've been looking for a reliable database that is decentralised and that easily connects to other Web3 infrastructure e.g. Arweave / Ethereum.  
This has been my motivation with creating extensions and tools for Kwil DB during this hackathon.

## Prizes
I am submitting code for both Kwil prizes: **Best use of Kwil** and **Best Kwil Extension**.
For the **Best use of Kwil** track I am submitting two projects: Kwil Admin UI and Kwil DB Sync.
For the **Best Kwil Extension** track I am submitting 3 extensions.
Further details about each project and their repositories is included below.

## Kwil Admin UI
The Kwil Admin UI is built using Next.JS and communicates with the local Kwil Server deployed within a Docker compose environment
